# Find Duplicate Context

You will be given a term, and another long list of terms.

Your task is to find if the term is directly a synonym of one of the other terms from the long list. Terms (X and Y) can be said to be synonyms if choosing an X, or choosing a way to act when X, is equivalent to choosing a Y, or choosing a way to act when Y.

Return a synonym term from the list, if one such term exist.
