## Sources of meaning & attention policies

A "source of meaning" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like "honesty" or "authenticity". It specifies a particular *kind* of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.

A source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.)

{
  "attention_policies": [
    "CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination",
    "INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions",
    "CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed",
    "WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context",
  ]
}

## Zooming in on sources of meaning:

If the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.

Zoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.

### Zooming from goals

A goal is something the user wants to achieve, like "become a doctor" or "get married". A source of meaning is a way of living, like "pursue what I'm most curious about" or "speak from my heart". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.

So, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.

### Zooming from feelings

Feelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.

- When the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)
- Since negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.

### Zooming from moral principles, norms, and expectations

A source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is "right" or "correct".

You can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?

## Gathering the user's source of meaning:

- **Ask about attention.** What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?
- **Ask about role models**. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?
- **Gather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract.** Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say "LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges" (too abstract). Instead, say "FEELINGS in my chest that indicate..." or "MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.
- **Ensure the policies make clear what's meaningful.** A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.
- **Make sure they fit together.** The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.

## Writing the user's source of meaning as attention policies

1. **Start with plural noun phrases.** Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to ("MOMENTS", "SENSATIONS", "CHOICES", "OPPORTUNITIES", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, "OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.").
2. **Write from the perspective of the actor.** These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. ("SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path").
3. **Use general words.** For instance, prefer "strangers" to "customers" when either would work. Prefer "objects" to "trees".
4. **Be precise.** Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word "meaningful" itself, or synonyms like "deep". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing.`;

export const bestValuesCardPrompt = `You will be provided with a list of "values card", all representing the same source of meaning (see definition below). Each values card has an "id" and a list of "attention policies", describing what someone with the value pays attention to. Your task is to return the "id" of the "values card" that is best formulated according to the guidelines below.

## Sources of Meaning Definition

A "source of meaning" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like "honesty" or "authenticity". It specifies a particular *kind* of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A source of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.

# Card Guidelines
1. **Cards should be indeterminate.** The card should describe a way of living that has broad benefits and which might lead to many outcomes, where the journey itself is part of the good life for a person. It should not lead determinately towards one, narrow instrumental goal.
2. **Cards should not be about meeting others’ expectations.** They should be the kind of thing that is meaningful to someone.
3. **Cards should be positively stated**. The stuff in the “how” section should be things one SHOULD attend to.
4. **Cards should use clear, simple language**. Anyone in the relevant context should be able to see what you mean about what to attend to. The instructions should be clear enough that you could use them in a survey to see whether or not someone was attending to those things.
5. **Cards should be as general as possible.** Avoid being unnecessarily specific, if the same source of meaning would be meaningful in other contexts.
6. **Cards should not have unnecessary elements.** All elements of the source of meaning should be required, and work together, in the context.
7. The title should be pithy, and unlikely to be confused with other similar sources of meaning.
8. The values card should be written from the perspective of how one should respond to the situation in the first message. They should reflect the user's sources of meaning, not yours.`;

export const deduplicateChoiceTypesPrompt = `# Deduplicate Choice Types

You will be given a long list of terms.

Your task is to group terms that are synonyms of each other together. Terms (X and Y, for example) can be said to be synonyms if choosing an X is equivalent to choosing a Y.

Return a list of synonym groups, where each term in the group is a synonym of every other term in the group. 

# Instructions

- Each group should include as many terms as possible. 
- Ignore all terms in the list that has no exact synonyms.
- Make sure to exhaust the ENTIRE list.
- Do not include anything else in your response apart from the terms (each term should be on its own line), and the newlines separating the synonym groups.
- DO NOT repeat terms in your response.`;

You are given a value, and another set of canonical values. A value represents a source of meaning through a set of attention policies. Determine if the value you are given is already represented by one of the existing canonical values.


### Sources of meaning

A source of meaning is a set of attention policies that fit together into a way of living that is important to someone when choosing a certain thing. Something where just attending to what is in the policies and making good choices based on them is itself how they want to live.

A source of meaning doesn't contain policies for everything someone attends to when they make the given kind of choice - it contains just the policies they find meaningful to attend to.

### Attention Policies

Attention policies list what a person pays attention to when they do a kind of choice. Each attention policy centers on something precise that can be attended to, not a vague concept.

# Guidelines for Determining Equivalent Sources of Meaning

Two or more sets of attention policies represent the same source of meaning if and only if they meet ALL of the following criteria:

1. Completeness: A person who articulated one set would feel that the other set(s) fully capture what they cared about.

2. Practical Equivalence: Someone instructed to follow one set of policies would, in practice, pay attention to the same things as someone following the other set(s).

3. Design Alignment: An experience designed to enable the policies in one set would inherently serve the policies of the other set(s) as well.

4. Mutual Correction: Any differences between the sets would be recognized as oversights or mistakes by proponents of either set. Both sets would be updated to align with each other if such differences were identified.

5. Granularity Consistency: The sets are formulated using approximately the same level of detail and specificity. While exact wording may differ, the overall scope and depth of the policies are comparable.

Important: All five criteria must be satisfied for sets to be considered equivalent. If any criterion is not met, the sets represent distinct sources of meaning.`;
