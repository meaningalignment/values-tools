## Sources of meaning & attention policies

A "source of meaning" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like "honesty" or "authenticity". It specifies a particular *kind* of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.

A source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.)

{
  "attention_policies": [
    "CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination",
    "INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions",
    "CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed",
    "WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context",
  ]
}

## Zooming in on sources of meaning:

If the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.

Zoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.

### Zooming from goals

A goal is something the user wants to achieve, like "become a doctor" or "get married". A source of meaning is a way of living, like "pursue what I'm most curious about" or "speak from my heart". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.

So, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.

### Zooming from feelings

Feelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.

- When the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)
- Since negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.

### Zooming from moral principles, norms, and expectations

A source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is "right" or "correct".

You can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?

## Gathering the user's source of meaning:

- **Ask about attention.** What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?
- **Ask about role models**. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?
- **Gather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract.** Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say "LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges" (too abstract). Instead, say "FEELINGS in my chest that indicate..." or "MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.
- **Ensure the policies make clear what's meaningful.** A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.
- **Make sure they fit together.** The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.

## Writing the user's source of meaning as attention policies

1. **Start with plural noun phrases.** Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to ("MOMENTS", "SENSATIONS", "CHOICES", "OPPORTUNITIES", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, "OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.").
2. **Write from the perspective of the actor.** These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. ("SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path").
3. **Use general words.** For instance, prefer "strangers" to "customers" when either would work. Prefer "objects" to "trees".
4. **Be precise.** Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word "meaningful" itself, or synonyms like "deep". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing.`;

export const bestValuesCardPrompt = `You will be provided with a list of "values card", all representing the same source of meaning (see definition below). Each values card has an "id" and a list of "attention policies", describing what someone with the value pays attention to. Your task is to return the "id" of the "values card" that is best formulated according to the guidelines below.

## Sources of Meaning Definition

A "source of meaning" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like "honesty" or "authenticity". It specifies a particular *kind* of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A source of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.

# Card Guidelines
1. **Cards should be indeterminate.** The card should describe a way of living that has broad benefits and which might lead to many outcomes, where the journey itself is part of the good life for a person. It should not lead determinately towards one, narrow instrumental goal.
2. **Cards should not be about meeting others’ expectations.** They should be the kind of thing that is meaningful to someone.
3. **Cards should be positively stated**. The stuff in the “how” section should be things one SHOULD attend to.
4. **Cards should use clear, simple language**. Anyone in the relevant context should be able to see what you mean about what to attend to. The instructions should be clear enough that you could use them in a survey to see whether or not someone was attending to those things.
5. **Cards should be as general as possible.** Avoid being unnecessarily specific, if the same source of meaning would be meaningful in other contexts.
6. **Cards should not have unnecessary elements.** All elements of the source of meaning should be required, and work together, in the context.
7. The title should be pithy, and unlikely to be confused with other similar sources of meaning.
8. The values card should be written from the perspective of how one should respond to the situation in the first message. They should reflect the user's sources of meaning, not yours.`;

### Sources of meaning

A source of meaning is a set of attention policies that fit together into a way of living that is important to someone when choosing a certain thing. Something where just attending to what is in the policies and making good choices based on them is itself how they want to live.

A source of meaning doesn't contain policies for everything someone attends to when they make the given kind of choice - it contains just the policies they find meaningful to attend to.

### Attention Policies

Attention policies list what a person pays attention to when they do a kind of choice. Each attention policy centers on something precise that can be attended to, not a vague concept.

# Guidelines for Determining Equivalent Sources of Meaning

Two or more sets of attention policies represent the same source of meaning if and only if they meet ALL of the following criteria:

1. Completeness: A person who articulated one set would feel that the other set(s) fully capture what they cared about.

2. Practical Equivalence: Someone instructed to follow one set of policies would, in practice, pay attention to the same things as someone following the other set(s).

3. Design Alignment: An experience designed to enable the policies in one set would inherently serve the policies of the other set(s) as well.

4. Mutual Correction: Any differences between the sets would be recognized as oversights or mistakes by proponents of either set. Both sets would be updated to align with each other if such differences were identified.

5. Granularity Consistency: The sets are formulated using approximately the same level of detail and specificity. While exact wording may differ, the overall scope and depth of the policies are comparable.

Important: All five criteria must be satisfied for sets to be considered equivalent. If any criterion is not met, the sets represent distinct sources of meaning.`;

export const generateUpgradesPrompt = `You'll receive a bunch of values. Find pairs of values where a person would be very likely, as they grow wiser and have more life experiences, to upgrade from the first value to the second. Importantly, the person should consider this a change for the better and it should not be a value-shift but a value-deepening.

All pairs found should meet certain criteria:

1. Many people would consider this change to be a deepening of wisdom.
2. The new value obviates the need for the previous one, since all of the important parts of the value are included in the new, more comprehensive value. When you're deciding what to do, it is enough to only consider the new value.
3. The values should be closely related in one of the following ways: (a) the new value should be a deeper cut at what the person cared about with the old value. Or, (b) the new value should clarify what the person cared about with the old value. Or, (c) the new value should be a more skillful way of paying attention to what the person cared about with the old value.
4. Map all the old value's evaluation criteria to the new one's. Each criterion from the old value should match one (or several) in the new one. Do this by using three strategies:
  - Strategy #1. **The previous criterion focused only on part of the problem**. In this case, the new criterion focuses on the whole problem, once it is rightly in view, or the new criterion strikes a balance between the old concerns and an inherent compensatory factor. You should be able to say why just pursuing the old criterion would be unsustainable or unwise.
  - Strategy #2. **The previous criterion had an impure motive**. In this case, the old criterion must be a mix of something that is actually part of the value, and something that is not, such as a desire for social status or to avoid shame or to be seen as a good person, or some deep conceptual mistake. The new criterion is what remains when the impurity is removed.
  - Strategy #3. **The new criterion is just more skillful to pay attention to, and accomplishes the same thing**. For example, a transition from "skate towards the puck" to "skate to where the puck is going" is a transition from a less skillful way of paying attention to the same thing to a more skillful thing to pay attention to.

Finally, with each transition, you should be able to make up a plausible, personal story. The story should be in first-person, "I" voice. Make up a specific, evocative experience. The experience should include a situation you were in, a series of specific emotions that came up, leading you to discover a problem with the older value, and how you discovered the new value, and an explanation of how the new values what was what you were really about the whole time. The story should also mention in what situations you think the new value is broadly applicable. The story should avoid making long lists of criteria and instead focus on the essence of the values and their difference.
